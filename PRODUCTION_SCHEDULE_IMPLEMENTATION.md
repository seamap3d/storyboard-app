# Production Schedule Implementation - Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented the Production Schedule feature for the ApeOnAWhale Storyboard application. The schedule now populates automatically when JSON is loaded and stays synchronized across all tabs.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created `renderProductionSchedule()` Function
**Location**: After `groupByDateAndLocation()` function (around line 970)

**Features**:
- Renders two views: "By Date & Location" and "By Scene Heading"
- Uses existing `groupByDateAndLocation()` and `groupBySceneHeading()` helper functions
- Displays empty state messages when no shots are scheduled
- Shows comprehensive information for each grouping:
  - **By Date & Location**: Date, location, scene headings, cast, props, and shot breakdown
  - **By Scene Heading**: Scene details, locations, shoot dates, cast, props, and shot list
- Exposed on `window.renderProductionSchedule` for global access

### 2. Added View Toggle Functionality
**Location**: Before "Tab switching" section (around line 1860)

**Features**:
- Event listeners for `btnViewByDate` and `btnViewByScene` buttons
- Toggles visibility between the two schedule views
- Updates button styling to show active state

### 3. Integrated with Tab Switching
**Location**: `setActiveTab()` function (around line 573)

**Features**:
- Calls `renderProductionSchedule()` when switching to the 'schedule' tab
- Ensures schedule is always up-to-date when viewed

### 4. Synchronized with Data Changes
**Integration Points**:
- `renderAll()` - Updates schedule when shots are re-rendered
- `hydrate()` - Populates schedule when JSON is imported
- `newShot()` - Updates schedule when new shots are added
- `persistFromDOM()` - Updates schedule when shots are reordered or modified

All calls use `window.renderProductionSchedule` for consistency.

## How It Works

### JSON as Database
The application treats the JSON structure (stored in `state.shots`) as the single source of truth:
1. When JSON is loaded via "Import JSON", `hydrate()` is called
2. `hydrate()` populates all views including the production schedule
3. Any modifications to shots update `state.shots` and trigger re-renders
4. Tab switching refreshes the schedule view with current data

### Automatic Synchronization
The schedule updates automatically when:
- JSON file is imported
- User switches to the Production Schedule tab
- Shots are added, modified, or reordered in the storyboard
- Data is edited in the Shot List spreadsheet

## Testing

### Test File Created
`test_schedule.json` - Contains sample data with:
- 6 shots across 3 different scenes
- 3 different shoot dates (Oct 10-12, 2025)
- 3 different locations
- Multiple cast members and props

### To Test
1. Open `http://localhost:8000` in browser
2. Click "Import JSON" and load `test_schedule.json`
3. Navigate to "Production Schedule" tab
4. Verify both views populate correctly:
   - "By Date & Location" should show 3 date groups
   - "By Scene Heading" should show 3 scene groups
5. Switch back to Storyboard and modify a shot
6. Return to Production Schedule to verify updates

## Key Benefits

✅ **Real-time synchronization**: All tabs reflect current data
✅ **Persistent state**: JSON structure maintained in memory
✅ **User-friendly**: Updates happen automatically on tab switches
✅ **Two viewing modes**: Date-based and scene-based organization
✅ **Comprehensive info**: Shows cast, props, locations, and shot breakdowns
✅ **Empty states**: Clear messaging when no data is available

## Technical Notes

- Function exposed on `window` object for global accessibility
- Consistent with existing `renderShotListTable` pattern
- Uses existing grouping logic (no duplication)
- Handles edge cases (unscheduled shots, missing data)
- Graceful degradation with type checking
